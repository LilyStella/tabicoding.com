                OpenProcessing is an online platform that allows people to share and explore creative coding projects made with p5.js 
                and other programming languages. It's like a social network for artists and programmers, where you can find, showcase, 
                and collaborate on interactive artworks and visual experiments. It's a great place to learn from others and get inspired 
                to create your own coding masterpieces!

                By using OpenProcessing, users can create sketches in the programming language called Processing even before they create an account.
                Once they create an account, they can do several things, such as save sketches, comment, favorite and fork other sketches, 
                follow other users, etc.
